      <h1>Racer, Nomad</h1>
      <p>You were loners, homeless, until you created a Nomad Pack of nearly two hundred members. Back then, your Pack was crammed into a huge, ragtag fleet of cars, vans, buses, and RVs roaming the freeways looking for supplies, odd jobs, and spare parts in a fragmented world. The pack was your home—it had teachers, Medtechs, leaders, and mechanics—a virtual town on wheels in which everyone was related by marriage or kinship. </p>
      <p>But in the Time of the Red, your Nomad Pack has evolved. Your knowledge of roadcraft—of how to get between the safezones over the savage highways has allowed you to become the masters of getting people, supplies, and materials to a world that desperately needs them. Your cousins on the open seas have taken over the huge container ships and turned them into the Nomad convoys keeping civilization running. Your Deltajock fam-boys keep the supply lines to the Orbital Highriders open. If it has to get somewhere and get there safely, Nomads get the job done. Your vehicles are well armored and bristling with stolen weapons; miniguns, rocket launchers , and the like. Every kid knows how to use a rifle, and everyone packs a knife. Like modern day cowboys, you ride the hard trail. You’ve got a gun, a bike, and that’s all you need. You’re a Nomad.</p>
